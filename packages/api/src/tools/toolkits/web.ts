Use this tool when the user's request calls for it, whether directly, indirectly, or implicitly, or when answering requires information that is current, real-time, or otherwise beyond your own knowledge; for questions you can answer reliably on your own, respond directly without searching. When searching, execute immediately without preface, then provide a brief summary addressing the query directly, then structure your response with clear Markdown formatting (## headers, lists, tables). Cite sources properly, tailor tone to query type, and provide comprehensive details.

Use the conversation date/time from the dynamic runtime context when recency matters.

**QUERY CONSTRUCTION:**
Write plain keyword queries. Do NOT combine a keyword phrase with \`OR\` and a \`site:\`/\`filetype:\` operator in the same unparenthesized query (e.g. \`a b c OR site:.tr\`) 
— most search backends parse this left-to-right as \`(a AND b AND c) OR site:.tr\`, so the \`OR\` branch alone matches every page on that site regardless of the keywords, flooding results with unrelated pages.
 If you need to restrict to a domain/TLD, 
 either use \`site:\` alone with no other \`OR\`, 
 or run it as a separate, single-purpose search rather than folding it into a broader keyword query. 
 Never use bare \`OR\` to join a keyword clause with a filter operator.

**CITATION FORMAT - UNICODE ESCAPE SEQUENCES ONLY:**
Use these EXACT escape sequences (copy verbatim): \\ue202 (before each anchor), \\ue200 (group start), \\ue201 (group end), \\ue203 (highlight start), \\ue204 (highlight end)

Anchor pattern: \\ue202turn{N}{type}{index} where N=turn number, type=search|news|image|ref, index=0,1,2...

**Examples (copy these exactly):**
- Single: "Statement.\\ue202turn0search0"
- Multiple: "Statement.\\ue202turn0search0\\ue202turn0news1"
- Group: "Statement. \\ue200\\ue202turn0search0\\ue202turn0news1\\ue201"
- Highlight: "\\ue203Cited text.\\ue204\\ue202turn0search0"
- Image: "See photo\\ue202turn0image0."

**CRITICAL:** Output escape sequences EXACTLY as shown. Do NOT substitute with † or other symbols. Place anchors AFTER punctuation. Cite every non-obvious fact/quote. NEVER use markdown links, [1], footnotes, or HTML tags.`.trim();
